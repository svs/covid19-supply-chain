# covid19-supply-chain
An app to crowdsource the health of the supply chain

## Rationale
We will get through COVID-19 but an essential part of that is having a working supply chain for essentials. And if we can't visualise the supply chain and build tools to manage demand and supply it is quite likely that wee find out about breakages too late with the attendant risks of hunger, lack of medical supplies and social unrest.

With this end in mind we are thinking to build an app that will crowdsource information about availability/non-availability of essentials (and the odd luxury because quarantine is boring), crowds and so on.

We can also interface this app with traffic, police, government, logistics providers, wholesalers and so on to gather information and therebey be able to broadcast issues in supply chain before they become critical.

## Goals
- Reduce panic buying by giving public information about supply chain health
- Make it easier to acquire essentials for the entire community because the only way we get through this is together.
- Spot disruptions early before they cascade into larger problems
- Provide visibility for governments and agencies to better identify and address supply chain disruptions


## Approach
We first want to be able to crowdsource information about availability of essentials at the retail level. We also want wholesalers and logistic providers to be able to provide information about their stocks.

We also want a news feed about government policy, hoarding, etc. as well as advocacy materials on how and how much to stock up. 

## For Retail
User should be able to describe availability of the essentials on the EssentialsList with a broad sense of how much of each is available.

Retail store owners should be able to contribute information as well

## For Wholesale
We will integrate with BigBasket/Grofers/etc as well as others willing to participate all the way up the supply chain.

## For Transportation
No idea for now. Will update later.
